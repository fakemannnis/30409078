      <h2>Cuisine</h2>
      <p>One of the most well-known aspects of Nepali culture is our delicious cuisine. We love our momos (dumplings) and dal bhat (rice and lentil soup), and no Nepali celebration is complete without them. We also have a rich tradition of making and drinking chai (tea), which is a staple of daily life for many Nepalis.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Music and Dance</h2>
      <p>Music and dance are also important parts of our culture. Our traditional folk songs and dances reflect the different regions and ethnic groups of Nepal, and they are often performed during festivals and special occasions. The sounds of the madal (drum) and the sarangi (stringed instrument) are especially popular in Nepali music.</p>

      <h2>Natural Beauty</h2>
      <p>Nepal is also known for its stunning natural beauty. From the Himalayas to the Terai plains, our country has a diverse landscape that is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. We are proud of our natural resources and work hard to protect them for future generations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Religion</h2>
      <p>Religion is an important part of Nepali culture. Hinduism and Buddhism are the two major religions in Nepal, and many Nepalis practice a combination of both. We have many beautiful temples and shrines throughout the country, and festivals like Dashain and Tihar are celebrated by people of all religions.</p>

    <section class="outro">
      <p>If you ever get the chance to visit Nepal, be sure to try some momos, listen to some traditional music, and soak in the beauty of our country.</p>
      <p>Dhanyabad! (Thank you!)</p>
